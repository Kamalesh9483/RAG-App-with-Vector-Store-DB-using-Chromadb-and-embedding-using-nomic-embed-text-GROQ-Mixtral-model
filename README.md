# RAG App with Vector Store DB using Chromadb and embedding using nomic-embed-text, GROQ (Mixtral model) for inferencing on Html content

![Flowchart](https://github.com/Kamalesh9483/RAG-App-with-Vector-Store-DB-using-Chromadb-and-embedding-using-nomic-embed-text-GROQ-Mixtral-model/assets/80197808/5a237858-0b6b-4947-b78e-9370ca8d5344)

## This project is on Retrieval Augumented Generation based on URL input
## 1. User Inputs the URL links and question to be asked from the URL links 
## 2. The HTML data is split as documents and converted to chunks and transformed to vector embeddings which is stored in Vector DB - Chrmadb
## 3. The GROQ uses Mixtral LLM model. GROQ is used for fast inference, the model reads the vector db and creates custom prompt on how to display the result
## 4. The results for the question asked is displayed
